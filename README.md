# CrystalCavern
The CrystalCavern is a small game in which you must overcome all obstacles and collect all crystals before you reach the end if you want pass next level.
You can change between Top-Down perspective to FPS, and I dare you to beat the game in FPS ;).

### Controls:
- Move: AWSD
- Sprint: ShiftL
- Perspective Top-Down: 1
- Perspective FPS: 2
- Rotate camera (only on FPS): Move mouse

### DebugMode:
- NextLevel: G
- RestartLevel: R

This is a project that I have done completing the course "Unreal Engine Blueprint Game Developer Online Course" of GameDev.tv.
